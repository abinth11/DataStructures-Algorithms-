## Introduction

Understanding data structures is essential for efficient software development. This repository serves as a resource for learning and implementing common data structures in JavaScript. You'll find clear explanations of each data structure, their use cases, and how to leverage them effectively.

## Data Structures

1. **Linked List**: Implementation of a singly linked list with insertion, deletion, and traversal methods.

2. **Stack**: A stack implementation demonstrating the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

3. **Queue**: A queue implementation showcasing the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) behavior.

4. **Binary Search Tree**: Creation of a binary search tree with search, insertion, and deletion functionalities.

5. **Hash Table**: Implementation of a hash table to store key-value pairs and handle collisions.

6. **Graph**: Introduction to graph data structure and various traversal algorithms.

7. **Heap**: Min-heap and max-heap implementations along with heap sort.

8. **Trie**: Construction of a trie for efficient prefix-based string searches.
